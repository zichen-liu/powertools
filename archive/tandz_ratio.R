#' Ratio Evaluating Accuracy of Normal Approximation for T Distribution in Sample Size Calculations
#'
#' This function calculates the ratio between (t_(nu, 1-beta) + t_(nu, 1 - alpha / 2))^2 / (z_(1-beta) + z_(1-alpha/2))^2. Sample size requirements using a normal distribution with include (z_(1-beta) + z_(1-alpha/2))^2 as a term, and sample sizes using the t distribution will include (t_(nu, 1-beta) + t_(nu, 1 - alpha / 2))^2 as a term. The ratio of these two terms provides the discrepancy between the normal approximation and t distribution.
#' Ratio values that exceed 1 indicate the normal approximation is underestimating the required sample size. Sample size requirements can be adjusted based on this ratio such that adjusted N = (unadjusted N) * ratio.

#' @param alpha The level of precision or type 1 error

#' # Suppose we calculated we needed 80 people using a normal approximation for
#' # 80% power at 0.05 alpha, then we can update the sample size calculation as:
#' original_ss <- 80
#' ratio <- tandz_ratio(alpha = 0.05, power = 0.8, df = 20)
#' N_adjusted <- ceiling(original_ss * ratio)
#' N_adjusted
