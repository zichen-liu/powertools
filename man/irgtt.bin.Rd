\item{n}{The total number of participants in the control arm.}

\item{p1}{The probability of the outcome in the control arm.}

\item{p2}{The probability of the outcome in the intervention arm.}

\item{icc}{The intraclass correlation coefficient in the intervention arm; defaults to 0.}

\item{alpha}{The significance level (type 1 error rate); defaults to 0.05.}

\item{power}{The specified level of power.}

\item{sides}{Either 1 or 2 (default) to specify a one- or two-sided hypothesis test.}

\item{v}{Either TRUE for verbose output or FALSE (default) to output computed argument only.}
}
\value{
A list of the arguments (including the computed one).

\description{
COmputes power and sample size for an individually randomized group treatment trial with
a binary outcome, in which after individual randomization, individuals in the
intervention/treatment arm are clustered.
