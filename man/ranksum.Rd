\title{Power calculation for rank-sum test}
\usage{
ranksum(
  n1 = NULL,
  n.ratio = 1,
  p = NULL,
  alpha = 0.05,
  power = NULL,
  sides = 2,
  v = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{n1}{The sample size in group 1.}

\item{n.ratio}{The ratio n2/n1 between the sample sizes of two groups; defaults to 1 (equal group sizes).}

\item{p}{The probability that an observation in group 2 is greater than an observation in group 1 (P(Y>X).}

\item{alpha}{The significance level (type 1 error rate); defaults to 0.05.}

\item{power}{The specified level of power.}

\item{sides}{Either 1 or 2 (default) to specify a one- or two-sided hypothesis test.}

\item{v}{Either TRUE for verbose output or FALSE (default) to output computed argument only.}
}
\value{
A list of the arguments (including the computed one).
}
\description{
This funcion performs power and sample size calculations for the
Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney rank-sum test, also called the Mann-Whitney U test,
which is the nonparametric analog of the two independent sample t test.
Calculations are based on the approximation given by
Noether (1987) Sample size determination for some common nonparametric tests. JASA 82(398):645-647.
}
\details{
Due to symmetry, the power for p is equal to the power for 1 - p. Therefore,
when solving for p, two values, p and 1 - p, are returned.

ranksum(n1 = 10, n.ratio = 1, p = 0.8, alpha = 0.05, power = NULL, sides = 2)
