}
\arguments{
\item{K}{The number of endpoints.}

\item{n1}{The sample size for group 1.}

\item{n.ratio}{The ratio n2/n1 between the sample sizes of two groups; defaults to 1 (equal group sizes).}

\item{delta}{A vector of length K of the true mean differences mu1k - mu2k; must all be positive.}

\item{Sigma}{The covariance matrix of the K outcomes, of dimension K x K.}

\item{sd}{A vector of length K of the standard deviations of the K outcomes.}

\item{rho}{A vector of length 0.5*K*(K-1) of the correlations among the K outcomes.}

\item{alpha}{The significance level or type 1 error rate; defaults to 0.025. A one-sided test is assumed.}

\item{power}{The specified level of power.}

\item{M}{Number of simulated values for the covariance matrix, simulated from Wishart distribution. Defaults
to 10000.}

\item{v}{Either TRUE for verbose output or FALSE to output computed argument only.}
}
\value{
A list of the arguments (including the computed one).

\description{
Computes power for test involving multiple co-primary continuous endpoints, assuming that the
covariance matrix (variances and covariances between endpoints) is unknown and therefore t-based test
statistics will be used. Studies with co-primary endpoints use “all-or-none” testing procedures and
only declare the trial to be a “success” if all endpoints are affirmed. All true mean differences
must be positive (the scale for some outcomes may need to be reversed
to meet this condition) and upper-tailed one-sided tests are assumed.
For known covariance matrix, see coprimary.z.

Either sd and rho or Sigma must be specified.

See Crespi et al. (2025) for more details.
This function is based on the power.unknown.var function from the mpe R package and material from
Sozu T, Sugimoto T, Hamasaki T, Evans SR. (2015) Sample Size Determination in Clinical Trials
with Multiple Endpoints. Springer International Publishing, Switzerland.

This function can be computationally intensive and slow when solving for sample size.
Smaller M can descrease computation time.
The function coprimary.z provides a close approximation and is much faster.
