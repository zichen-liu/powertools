\title{Cohen f effect size calculation for one- or two- way analysis of variance}
\usage{
es.anova.f(means = NULL, sd = NULL, v = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{means}{A vector or matrix of group means.}

\item{sd}{The estimated standard deviation within each group.}

\item{v}{Either TRUE for verbose output or FALSE to output computed argument only.}
}
\value{
Various calculated f effect sizes.
}
\description{
Takes as input the cell or group means for a one- or two-way ANOVA and the common
standard deviation and outputs the f effect size, as defined by Cohen (1988). Note that
this effect size calculation is only valid when cell/group sizes are equal.
