\title{Power for test of heterogeneity of treatment effect in a multisite trial}
\usage{
multisite.hte(
  m = NULL,
  alloc.ratio = 1,
  J = NULL,
  VR = NULL,
  alpha = 0.05,
  v = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{m}{The mean number of subjects per site.}

\item{alloc.ratio}{The allocation ratio of intervention/control subjects per site; defaults to 1.}

\item{J}{The total number of sites.}

\item{VR}{The variance ratio (variance of the site-level treatment effects divided by variance of
observations within sites) under the alternative.}

\item{alpha}{The significance level (type 1 error rate); defaults to 0.05.}

\item{v}{Either TRUE for verbose output or FALSE (default) to output computed argument only.}
}
\value{
A list of the arguments (including the computed power).
}
\description{
Calculates power for a test of heterogeneity of the treatment effect
in a multisite trial with a continuous outcome variable. In particular,
let sigma.u1^2 be the variance of the site-level treatment effects.
The test of heterogeneity tests the null hypothesis that sigma.u1^2 = 0
versus the alternative that sigma.u1^2 > 0.
