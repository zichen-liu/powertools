\arguments{
\item{K}{The number of endpoints.}

\item{n1}{The sample size for group 1.}

\item{n.ratio}{The ratio n2/n1 between the sample sizes of two groups; defaults to 1 (equal group sizes).}

\item{delta}{A vector of length K of the true mean differences mu1k - mu2k; must all be positive.}

\item{Sigma}{The covariance matrix of the K outcomes, of dimension K x K.}

\item{sd}{A vector of length K of the standard deviations of the K outcomes.}

\item{rho}{A vector of length 0.5*K*(K-1) of the correlations among the K outcomes.}

\item{alpha}{The significance level or type 1 error rate; defaults to 0.025. A one-sided test is assumed.}

\item{power}{The specified level of power.}

\item{M}{The number of simulation.}

\item{min.n}{Minimum value of n1; used in search for n1 to achieve desired power.}

\item{max.n}{Maximum value of n1; used in search for n1 to achieve desired power.}
}
\value{
A list of the arguments (including the computed one).
