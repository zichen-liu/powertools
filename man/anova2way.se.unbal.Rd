\title{Power calculation for test of simple effect for two-way unbalanced analysis of variance}
\usage{
anova2way.se.unbal(
  nmatrix = NULL,
  mmatrix = NULL,
  cmatrix = NULL,
  sd = 0,
  Rsq = 0,
  ncov = 0,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{nmatrix}{A matrix of sample sizes (see example).}

\item{mmatrix}{A matrix of group means (see example).}

\item{cmatrix}{A matrix of contrast coefficients (see example).}

\item{sd}{The estimated standard deviation within each group.}

\item{Rsq}{The estimated R^2 for regressing the outcome on the covariates; defaults to 0.}

\item{ncov}{The number of covariates adjusted for in the model; defaults to 0.}

\item{alpha}{The significance level (type 1 error rate); defaults to 0.05.}

\item{v}{Either TRUE for verbose output or FALSE (default) to output computed argument only.}
}
\value{
A list of the arguments (including the computed power).

\description{
Conducts power calculations for a test of a simple effect in a two-way
unbalanced (unequal cell sizes) ANOVA.
A "simple effect" is a contrast among the cell means.
This function does not solve for sample size.
For a test of a contrast in a balanced (equal
cell sizes) two-way ANOVA, anova2way.se.bal can also be used and can
solve for sample size. For a test of contrast among
factor levels, see anova2way.c.unbal.
