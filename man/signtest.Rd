\title{Power calculation for sign test (one-sample test for a median)}
\usage{
signtest(N = NULL, p = NULL, alpha = 0.05, power = NULL, sides = 2, v = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{N}{The sample size.}

\item{p}{The probability of a positive difference when the alternative hypothesis is true.}

\item{alpha}{The significance level (type 1 error rate); defaults to 0.05.}

\item{power}{The specified level of power.}

\item{sides}{Either 1 or 2 (default) to specify a one- or two-sided hypothesis test.}

\item{v}{Either TRUE for verbose output or FALSE (default) to output computed argument only.}
}
\value{
A list of the arguments (including the computed one).
}
\description{
The sign test is a nonparametric one-sample test of location, specifically,
a test of whether the median
equals (or is less than or greater than) zero. Its typical use is in place of
a one-sample or paired t test when the normality assumption is violated.
This function performs power and sample size calculations for a sign test
using the normal approximation to the binomial distribution, based on
Noether (1987) Sample size determination for some common nonparametric tests. JASA 82(398):645-647.

Power calculation
for an exact sign test using the exact binomial test can be performed
using the power_binom_test function from the MESS package;
see Crespi CM (2025) Power and Sample Size in R. Routledge, New York, NY.
}
\details{
Due to symmetry, the power for p is equal to the power for 1 - p. Therefore,
when solving for p, two values, p and 1 - p, are returned.

signtest(N = 40, p = 0.7, power = NULL, alpha = 0.05, sides = 1)
